Overview: ContentMATCH is  social media engagement growth tool used by content creators to increase their engagements organically and for them to meet other creators to collaborate and increase their engagements.  our app is unique because we in bed content from YouTube Instagram tiktok on our platform and the more you give out feedback and engagement request with proof the more your own content that you embed an hour app will grow 

Description: What is it?
…
What is content match is a tool for Content creators which are YouTubers Instagram twitch streamers tiktokers typically those who are trying to grow and are on the smaller side or those who have a community on Discord already on the smaller side but want to grow that app in the whole purpose of it is to encourage Mutual engagement Mutual engagement means if I am a person who is interested in a particular niche and I engage with one of your content such as I engage in one of your YouTube videos or tiktok videos then I would want an equal engagement back so the whole purpose of the platform is to bring together people who are in the same niches you also trying to mutually grow and people who would engage in show proof that they engage. the whole purpose of this is in hopes to kickstart or let your content be viewed out more within any given social media algorithm

Problem: What problem is this solving?
 the problem that we're solving is the fact that many consecrators suffer from not getting enough engagement views in reach because the social media algorithms typically want you to already have some type of external fandom or Google people to engage with you or you have to use ads in order to get reach so it's like a chicken or a egg type of thing it's like unique in order for you to get reach you need more people to engage with you and how do you get that you need more you need to get more reach and also we are solving the problem of helping creators grow growing is not just getting your engagement getting your engagement up growing is about seeing how you can improve and one of the many ways that we try to help them improve is by feedback and creators getting valuable feedback on the content is viable and crucial.
...

Why: How do we know this is a real problem and worth solving?

…
 the way we know it's a real problem is we're solving is because back in 2021 I started a discourse server and this Discord server already has 3,600 people. also I've been in the world of social media and marketing and to get engagement is always an issue unless you're playing with money or you know you have someone gives you a put on and that's you know difficult and costly so me just trying to grow as a consecrator is hard so that's why it's a real problem we're solving and one more thing I've talked to content creators again I have a discourse over 3,600 contributors they told me that hey since a lot of them are small creators and or mid-size getting the region engagement is hard in order for them to be viewed out more and also getting valuable feedback is hard in a good platform.

Success: How do we know if we’ve solved this problem? 

…
The way we know we saw the problem is simple we already have solve the problem we've seen creators engagements and analytics and overall reach grow and not only that our creators actual content itself became better with better edits better storyboarding and everything necessary to create a nice and beautiful engaging content for YouTube tiktok Instagram we saw this issue when the platform the app in Discord bot helps us drive in more users and generates the content match team more Revenue while providing our users a excellent experience.

Audience: Who are we building for?

…
 we are building this product for Content creators and community heads of communities who want to drive engagement and get more Outreach this particularly can pertain to a brand or a single person. this is for people whose whole thing is getting more reach and engagement and are on the smaller to mid-size point.

What: Roughly, what does this look like in the product?
 so the product has already been created and has gone through multiple iteration the way the product looks like is an app that a user can use and users can post links in beds of their content from YouTube Instagram Tik Tok and the more that said user engages with other people's content on the app by giving feedback and mutually engaging and showing proof that they mutually engage The more their own content that they themself has uploaded on our product on our app grows. and simplified term you scratch my back I scratched yours. community admins of communities who already have a large pool to tap in they can create and invite their community members  to the group section of content match where it's a version of content match where the admins can set up the engagement rules the certain rules for community and they have their own minified version of content match. and finally there's a section where creators can basically meet other creators to collaborate and further mutually grow and grow their engagement so you can find other creators who are looking to grow and collaborate similar to a dating feature but none of the dating points.

How: Does the product work and the plan

The way the product works and the plan for us to successfully launch is the app boost creators content which they embedded into content match ( that content is from YouTube tiktok Instagra) so the more the Creator goes on our app engages with other people's embedded videos and content from the original social media platform and shows proof that they engaged the more feedbacks, the more we our own algorithm boost that person's own content on content match to meet other creators and have better and more engagement requests engagement opportunities and collaboration requests.

Core Features Breakdown

Recommendation System / Algorithm 
The first core feature that needs to be implemented is our algorithm recommendation system. this algorithm and recommendation system should do many things one it should increase or push users who engage give feedback the most, and are more active above users who don't do that.
 the algorithm must recommend users based off of Niche platform audience size age range gender location.
Purpose:  the purpose of this is to have an algorithm that benefits the users and actually benefits the content creator because their engagement and effort they have put in will be directly beneficial for them. 
Recommended users to each other 
 recommend content for users to engage
 recommend communities to users
  should boost users who are the most active most engaged most sent feedback
 this recommended system should also respect the communities set rules
 also recommend users content based off their interest age demographic and if said user is going to engage back 

2. MATCHING Feature / Inspired by dating app lunch club

This matching feature is considered to be similar to “Tinder” and or lunch club (Popular business meeting app)(Popular dating app) and others. 
The purpose of this feature is to match users (who are content creators) To other creators. Who share the same “purpose” /goals with each other. 

Example. “Jeffrey wants to meet other creators around his age range , gender and or demographic / niche. “ Either for collaboration or Feedback or engagement requests. 


Users Who are free members will have limited amount of daily interactions and actions
Users will get recommended matches and be notified . 
Users Can put their engagement goals or what ever the reason they want when they onboard.
Free Users can’t directly dm people that they are not connected to . 

3. Notifications Emails, System (Email, Push , SMS) 

The notification system is one that needs to be very detailed and we have to make sure it works . This system will be divided in two parts For email and push 

Email: All important “business” information will be sent via email

This ad feature is used to help generate money for the app. Free users will be the ones who see ads. Its important to understand that there are 2 kinds of ads On the platform. The current one we are talking about is called “Adsense” Ads . these are the basic ads we get from google adsense, Includes Banner, Intersectional , Popup. 
Every page must have atleast one ads. Based on the layout we got. 
After 4-5 videos watched, one unskipabble will popup 
There will be different types of Ads
Banner, 
On the sidepanels 
After content watched (Full unskippable)(Soundcloud)
4.5 Ads User Boosted (Not to Important) (Future)
The purpose of this feature is to create our own internal boosting system, where users can buy “boosts” These boots will serve in place of the ads . So basically the ads of google adsense will be replaced by Users content. 

Example: The different type of contents/”ads”  you will see 
You will see boosted content, in the form of regular “content” on contentmatch
Just with the super engage and feedback buttons 
It will say boosted on the top . 
We will show boosted content on the right hand side, (banners) as well as the intersectional. 
Paid users will still see boosted content in the form of “recommendation” and boosted posts that show up in their feed. 


5.0 Localisation / SEO Page
